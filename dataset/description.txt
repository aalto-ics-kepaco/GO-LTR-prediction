README:

The UniProt identifiers of the proteins used in the respective ontologies are specified in
a. mfo_sequences_uniprot_ids.txt
b. cco_sequences_uniprot_ids.txt
c. bpo_sequences_uniprot_ids.txt

Using these identifiers, one can query for the full specification of the proteins in the UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB). The ascession numbers given by UniProt can then be used to query other databases like AlphaFoldDB, RheaDB, etc
